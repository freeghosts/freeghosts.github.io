                    <p>Please note that we use a third-party service to process form data. While their privacy and security policies state that the form owner (i.e. Freeghosts) is the sole data controller and submitted data is protected in transit by TLS 1.2 or greater and stored encrypted using AES-256 encryption, their servers are located in the United States of America. Therefore, any data you submit to us via the Contact Form will be processed and stored in the U.S. More information can be found at:
